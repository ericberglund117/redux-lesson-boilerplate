## information 

MapStateToProps was not grabbing the necessary state to be displayed. So I reworked the application to include react-redux hooks (useSelector, useDispatch, useForm)

### Setup

This app was created using the `create-react-app` boilerplate.

#### Install Dependencies
`npm install`  

#### Start Dev Server
`npm start`  

### Run Tests
`npm test`
